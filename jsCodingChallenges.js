// Coding Challenge #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. StoreMark'sandJohn'smassandheightinvariables
// 2. CalculateboththeirBMIsusingtheformula(youcanevenimplementboth
// versions)
// 3. CreateaBooleanvariable'markHigherBMI'containinginformationabout
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
// Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

// 2. UseatemplateliteraltoincludetheBMIvaluesintheoutputs.Example:"Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
// Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰ GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
// other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
// and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
// as well (draw means they have the same average score)
// 4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
// both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
// points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
